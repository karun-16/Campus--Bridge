  Problem Statement / Use Case :
                                 " Students often struggle to juggle multiple platforms for coursework, coding practice, and academic progress tracking. 
                                    There is a need for a unified platform that streamlines learning and skill development in one place."

Abstract / Problem Description:  
   Students face difficulties managing academic resources, tracking progress, and practicing coding—all of which are often spread across different platforms. Campus Bridge addresses this issue by offering a 
   centralized LMS that also includes coding skill development features. It simplifies academic workflows and promotes consistent coding practice by integrating course management, assessments, and real-time coding 
   challenges within a single dashboard. This platform empowers students to stay organized, improve technical skills, and achieve academic excellence—without switching tabs.



   Tech Stack Used :
                       Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
                       Backend: Node.js, Express.js
                       Database: MongoDB
                       Authentication: JWT
                       Version Control: Git & GitHub

                       

 Project Explanation :
 
 Campus Bridge is a unified academic and coding development platform tailored for university students.
 It bridges the gap between academic learning and technical skill-building by combining an LMS (Learning Management System) with coding training and AI-powered assistance—all in one integrated platform.

 Core Objective  

To provide students, faculty, and admins with a centralized, intuitive tool that streamlines academic management, coding practice, and performance tracking—enhancing both learning outcomes and job readiness.

 Student Interface  

- **Academic Module (LMS)**  
  - Access enrolled courses, lecture notes (PDFs/videos), assignments, and attendance records.  
  - Interact with faculty and stay up-to-date with academic activities, mimicking platforms like *MyCamu*.

- **Coding Skill Development**  
  - Enroll in curated coding tracks such as Data Structures, Web Development, Python, and Java.  
  - Practice problems using a built-in, multi-language online compiler (C, C++, Python, Java).  
  - Visualize progress using skill heatmaps, achievement badges, and streak counters.

---

 Faculty & Trainer Panel  

- Upload academic content, quizzes, and schedules for course delivery.  
- Design coding assignments with predefined test cases and difficulty levels.  
- Track academic engagement and coding performance via detailed analytics dashboards.

---

 Admin & Placement Cell Panel  

- View student performance across academics and coding through leaderboards and metrics.  
- Schedule and manage mock coding tests, contests, and check eligibility for placement.  
- Export detailed performance reports for faculty, students, and placement officers.
